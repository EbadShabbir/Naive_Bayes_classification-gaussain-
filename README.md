## Project Overview

This project uses a Naive Bayes classifier to analyze and predict purchasing behavior. Key steps include data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, and visualizing decision boundaries for both training and test sets.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Social Network Ads** dataset, which includes information about user age, estimated salary, and whether or not they purchased a product. You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) and place it in your project directory under the path: `input/social-network-adslogistic-regressionbinomial/Social Network Ads.csv`.

### Features:
- **Age**: Age of the user
- **Estimated Salary**: Salary estimation of the user

### Target:
- **Purchased**: Whether the user purchased the product (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
